# Atm-Machine-PYTHON-
Project Description
ATM System Simulation
This ATM System project is a Python-based simulation that emulates basic banking operations typically found in an ATM. Designed for educational purposes, this project allows users to interact with a simulated ATM to perform various functions.

Key Features
Account Management: Users can check their account balance, withdraw funds, deposit money, and change their PIN.
Persistent Storage: Account details, including balances and PINs, are stored in a text file (accounts.txt), ensuring data persists across program executions.
Security: Users must enter a valid PIN to access their account, and can change their PIN for added security.
Simple Interface: The program provides a straightforward, command-line interface for interaction.
Purpose
This project serves as a practical example of implementing basic file handling and user interaction in Python. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and file I/O in the context of a simple banking application. The goal is to provide a clear, functional example of how these concepts can be applied to create a working application.
