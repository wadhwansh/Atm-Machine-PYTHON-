# Atm-Machine-PYTHON-
<b>Project Description<br></b>
<b>ATM System Simulation</b><br>
This ATM System project is a Python-based simulation that emulates basic banking operations typically found in an ATM. Designed for educational purposes, this project allows users to interact with a simulated ATM to perform various functions.<br><br>

<b>Key Features<b><br></b>
<b><i>Account Management:</b></i> Users can check their account balance, withdraw funds, deposit money, and change their PIN.
<br><b><i>Persistent Storage:</b></i> Account details, including balances and PINs, are stored in a text file (accounts.txt), ensuring data persists across program executions.
<br><b><i>Security:</b></i> Users must enter a valid PIN to access their account, and can change their PIN for added security.
<br><b><i>Simple Interface:</b></i> The program provides a straightforward, command-line interface for interaction.
<br><b>Purpose<br></b>
This project serves as a practical example of implementing basic file handling and user interaction in Python. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and file I/O in the context of a simple banking application. The goal is to provide a clear, functional example of how these concepts can be applied to create a working application.
